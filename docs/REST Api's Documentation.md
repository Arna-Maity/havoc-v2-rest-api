# REST API's

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a software architecture style that relies on a stateless communications protocol, most commonly, HTTP.

# Some Key Features!!!

  - It is more simpler than SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).
  - It is stateless.
  - It has a proper documentation.
  - It gives you proper logging of error.for e.g you are creating a REST API using specific framework and then if you stuck somewhere, then what happens is you get a proper message about the error so that user can         understand easily and debug.
  - It is very data-driven compared to SOAP.
